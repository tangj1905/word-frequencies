# word-frequencies
Takes in a plaintext document, and outputs a list of all of the words along with the number of times each word shows up. This program utilizes a hash table, which was coded by hand (instead of using Java's HashMap or Hashtable). The sample input document used was the United States Constitution, but any plaintext file can be used instead.

This program was finished on April 3rd, 2020.
